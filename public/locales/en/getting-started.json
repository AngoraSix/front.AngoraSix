You only need to give it a name, indicate what stage it's in, and then define how you want to manage governance and finances within the team.\n\nYou can review each option in detail and adjust the configuration to match how your team works today. If something doesn't fit your current practices, let us know — we can help or prepare new configurations for your case.",

You’ll also find key project metrics and your own activity.\n\nThis information helps the whole team organize its governance, agreements, and resource management in a more transparent and decentralized way.\n\nWe also recommend adopting a methodology that allows you to review and refine ownership management over time.",
